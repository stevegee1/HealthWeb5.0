# Welcome to HealthWeb 5.0
_...building a personal web for your health records_

## Inspiration

Electronic health/medical records (EHRs/EMRs) are designed to facilitate the sharing of information among various healthcare providers, including laboratories and specialists. As a result, they contain data from all clinicians participating in the patient's care. According to the National Alliance for Health Information Technology, EHR data "can be created, managed, and accessed by authorized clinicians and staff across multiple healthcare organizations."

Storing and sharing medical data is a vital aspect of healthcare systems. However, sharing personal data through insecure channels poses a significant risk of critical information leakage. Additionally, the lack of client control over their personal information can result in adverse consequences, allowing unauthorized individuals to access or edit personal medical details. Sharing patient details introduces further risks. The key challenge in electronic health/medical records (EHR/EMR) lies in maintaining interoperability among various involved entities, causing hindrances in data transactions. The lack of a robust data management and sharing mechanism leads to healthcare information fragmentation. Beyond interoperability, data security and privacy pose challenges in the current methods of storing and sharing data through EHR/EMR systems, with potential liabilities due to data leakage and security shortcomings. HealthWeb 5.0 to the rescue!


# What we do

HealthWeb 5.0 is a project built on Web 5 - Web 5 is a decentralized platform that provides a new identity layer for the web to enable decentralized apps and protocols. This project harnesses the strength of the three main novel innovative pillars of Web 5.0:

## Decentralized Identifiers
Patients within clinics, healthcare hubs, and health institutions have unique decentralized identifiers directly associated with them. These identifiers are owned and controlled by the patients, eliminating the need for centralized entities to authenticate and manage our identities.

## Verifiable Credentials
Healthcare institutions do not need to trust one another to engage and verify claims made by patients - A trustless interaction!

## Decentralized Web Node (DWN)
Currently, centralized entities store our data. HealthWeb 5.0 introduces the potential to separate our medical records/data from the application, meaning there's no need for the application to manage your data privacyâ€”it stays with you. Consequently, you can grant or revoke access to your data across health institutions.
