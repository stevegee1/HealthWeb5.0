# HealthWeb5.0
Storing and sharing medical data is a vital aspect of healthcare systems. However, sharing personal data through insecure channels poses a significant risk of critical information leakage. Additionally, the lack of client control over their personal information can result in adverse consequences, allowing unauthorized individuals to access or edit personal medical details. Sharing patient details introduces further risks. The key challenge in electronic health/medical records (EHR/EMR) lies in maintaining interoperability among various involved entities, causing hindrances in data transactions. The lack of a robust data management and sharing mechanism leads to healthcare information fragmentation. Beyond interoperability, data security and privacy pose challenges in the current methods of storing and sharing data through EHR/EMR systems, with potential liabilities due to data leakage and security shortcomings. HealthWeb 5.0 to the rescue!
